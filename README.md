# PyBer_Analysis

The Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to review the ride sharing data by city type and its total weekly fares for the early part of 2019. 

Results:
The week over week data shows total fares by urban drivers outperform both suburban and rural drivers. The lowest performing week for urban drivers is still 3X better than rural city's best week. However, if you look at the average fares per ride and driver, rural cities outperform both urban and suburban drivers. This is due to the reality that urban cities have the highest driver count compared to both suburbs and rural cities. 

Summary:
Based on the findings we should apply the following changes to increase revenue:
Recruit more drivers in suburban areas. Suburban areas have less than â…“ the driver count compared to urban areas but it brought in ~50% of urban fares
We can better serve the rural areas by recruiting more drivers
Increase fares in urban areas
